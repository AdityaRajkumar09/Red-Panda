        <h2>Conservation status</h2>
        <h3>Because of the Red Panda's secretive nature and nocturnal habits, observation of it is very difficult. India has protected 20 areas with known or possible red panda populations in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and West Bengal such as Khangchendzonga, Namdapha and Singalila National Parks, and a coordinated conservation policy for the red panda and as new eco-friendly alternatives for deforestation have been developed, Red panda population trends are becoming less steep.</h3><br>
